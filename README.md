Machine Learning
1) Linear Regression (LinReg, L1-Lasso, L2-Ridge, Blood Preasure Case, Moore's Law)
2) Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression (Sigmoid, Forward, Basic Gradient Descent, Cross Entropy Error Function)
3) Supervised Learning: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN, Donut & XOR Problem solved, KNN fails case)
