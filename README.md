Machine Learning
1) Supervised Learning: Linear Regression (LinReg, L1-Lasso, L2-Ridge, Blood Preasure Case, Moore's Law)
2) Supervised Learning: Logistic Regression (Sigmoid, Forward, Basic Gradient Descent, Cross Entropy Error Function)
3) Supervised Learning: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN, Donut & XOR Problem solved, KNN fails case)
4) Supervised Learning: Bayes (Naive, Non Naive(Covariance Matrix))
5) Supervised Learning: Perceptron
6) Supervised Learning: KNN/Decision Tree Regression 
7) Machine Learning as Web Service (Tornado, Pickle, Random Forest Classifier)
8) Supervised Learning: Ensemble Methods (Bias Variance Tradeoff, Bootstrap, Bagging, Random Forest, AdaBoost)
9) NLP: Article Spinner, Cipher Genetic Algorithm, Latent Semantic Analysis (SVD), Sentiment Analyzer (LogReg), Spam Detection (Naive Bayes, AdaBoost)
